## üìñ Description

PlayerCustomDisplay goes beyond just setting a static fake player count. It allows you to set a "base" number, and the plugin will dynamically add the current number of online players to it. This creates a realistic and lively player count that changes as players join and leave your server.

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Dynamic Player Count:** The count shown in the server list is the sum of your base number and the actual online player count.
  - **Easy Configuration:** Set the base player count instantly with a simple in-game command.
  - **Live Stats:** Use a command to see exactly how the current player count is being calculated.
  - **Lightweight:** The plugin is designed to be simple and have a minimal impact on server performance.
  - **Permission-Based:** Control who can change the settings with a single permission node.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Commands & Permissions

The plugin uses a single permission node to control access to all commands.

| Permission                  | Description                             | Default |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `playercustomdisplay.admin` | Grants access to all `/pcd` commands. | OP      |

| Command                | Description                                                                                             | Usage                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `/pcd set <number>`    | Sets the base number for the player count. Use `-1` to disable the feature and show the real player count. | `/pcd set 100`        |
| `/pcd stat`            | Shows the current status and calculation of the displayed player count.                                 | `/pcd stat`           |

## üîß Configuration

The `config.yml` file is simple and allows you to set the base player count manually. The value set by the `/pcd set` command will be saved here automatically.

**File: `config.yml`**

# For example, if this is set to 200 and 5 players are online, the list will show 205.

custom-player-count: -1
```
